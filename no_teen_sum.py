# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a
# teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except
# 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper
# "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that
# value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating
# the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below
# and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().

# no_teen_sum(1, 2, 3) â†’ 6
# no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) â†’ 3
# no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) â†’ 3
